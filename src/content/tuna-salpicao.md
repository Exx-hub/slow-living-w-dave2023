Introducing Tuna Salpicao—a creative twist on the beloved Filipino classic, Beef Salpicao. This delectable dish was born out of the need to accommodate my wife's dietary preferences, which exclude chicken, pork, and beef. As a fitting alternative, I turned to tuna, often dubbed the "chicken of the sea," for its comparable texture. Dive into a delightful culinary experience as you savor the unique flavors and textures of Tuna Salpicao.
